### General Information / Behind the scenes.

Aeroforge Grid was originally a map named "A Fairly ode to destruction", the lore had some references about a lost planet and a Queen that was overthrown by the Strogg/dark ones keeping the gray horror theme, this was around 2024 when QBJ3 was pushed back and my idea was just that it was going to be just Quake with some slight modifications, and at the time Phoenyx made a loop of Repulsive's song, i kept it saved for a year until the jam was properly announced.


The original map idea was deleted as it was nothing special, but i kept the idea of certain geo/architecture at the beginning, and spawning on a beach, that proof of concept had just a beach and and just some geo/architecture... starting from that same idea and adding along the way the map was born, one thing i kept was the industrial/tech/concrete theme i always intended the map to be.


From the new progs (QBJ3) i used all enemies in the mod, i had more plans of using the Sploder, but the main problem is that i play in Nightmare mostly and i playtest in Nightmare mostly, in this difficulty/skill the enemy is a high risk insta-kill enemy, overall i kept it in some sequences of the map, however there's no sploder in Easy/normal skill. I also stuck in switching skins of the monsters at times, this was one of my favorite features of QBJ3.

A lot of the rework time invested in this map was mostly retextures and some balance work across skills Easy/Normal - Hard/Nightmare, shout out to those who helped playtesting the map! special mention to PuLSaR, and in this map it's the first time i use a compile with extra4, surface_radiosity and emissivequality high, so the "neon lights" surface lights wouldn't look too unnatural, i've learned this thanks to Rabbit who applied it in his SPRAWL map.


A final fun fact is that there are a lot of references to the Sunlust Doom wad, even the final part of the level is a recreation of the exit area of Map 31 of Sunlust "Birds of a Feather", i intended to make a song switch to the music used in MAP31 "Windows - Stuart Rynn", as i've made a remaster and was planning to use it but the brutalist jam rules stuck just one song per map, There's a Target_music entity that changes the music of a map during the level within Copper's entities, hope we can use it in the future.


The "Windows" cover i made of the song by Stuart Rynn (stewboy) was a story by itself, the original MIDI had an acoustic instrument patch, when i converted the MIDI to FLEX patches in FL Studio, no acoustic guitar was convincing enough for me, so i switched that instrument to a Sytrus electronic guitar patch, so the song is more "electronic rock and roll" with melodic tunes... if you wanna check it out here it is in my soundcloud [Windows - Stuart Rynn cover by Blood Instinct](https://soundcloud.com/blood-instinct-72/windows-stuart-rynn)


I wanna give a special shoutout to Phoenyx for helping me learn music with FL Studio and i thank her for doing the loop version of this song, also special shoutout to Makkon for his textures, his art was a key element for my map to exist for Brutalist Jam 3.


Thank you, enjoy my map, best wishes for you and your loved ones!


Shine with style!

### Special thanks

A special shoutout to Ribbiks and dannebubinga for making Sunlust (Doom wad) as it's aesthetic and a bit of difficulty dynamics have inspired my mapping skills in a sort of way. <3
